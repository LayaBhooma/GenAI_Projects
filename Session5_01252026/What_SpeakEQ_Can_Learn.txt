What SpeakEQ Can Learn (and Improve On)
-------------------------------------------
Here’s where we can stand apart and add real emotional depth:
1. Go Beyond Just Delivery, Focus on Emotional Alignment
Orai tells users “you spoke too fast” or “used too many fillers.”
 SpeakEQ can say:
“You wanted to sound calm, but your tone projected anxiety. Let’s realign that.”
That’s a huge psychological shift.
2. Anxiety Detection as a Core Feature
Orai assumes practice reduces anxiety. We identify it live, voice tremors, sudden pacing shifts, long silences. This will be life-changing for users with ADHD, ASD, or speech anxiety.
3. Grammar Feedback in Spoken Context
This competitor does not give post-session grammatical coaching. We can analyze clarity, repetition, filler overuse, and suggest smarter sentence construction, great for ESL and professional growth.
4. Real-Time Emotional Coaching (Not Just Metrics)
Instead of just telling users what went wrong, SpeakEQ can guide them in real-time:
“Take a breath. Let’s slow the pace. Try expressing more warmth now.”
5. Personalized, Therapeutic Tone
Orai’s tone is “train to win.” SpeakEQ can be the safe, supportive coach that doesn’t just improve your speech, it helps you express your truth.
6. Brand Identity That Reflects Compassion
Instead of expressionless avatars, we can use soft, warm colors, expressive faces, and more emotionally intelligent visuals to make the brand feel alive, empathetic, and inviting.
7. Depth > Volume in Content Strategy
Rather than pushing daily blogs, we can publish insightful guides, emotional storytelling, and partner with therapists and coaches to co-author content, building trust over traffic.

1. Repetitive Content
Several reviews mentioned the same posture and breathing tips are repeated before every speaking session.
It starts to feel monotonous, especially to regular users.
2. Lack of Depth in Some Areas
Some users feel there isn’t enough advanced or varied content ,  especially in specific contexts like interviewing, persuasive speaking, or industry-specific scenarios.
3. No Quantified Progress Tracking
Users want performance metrics with numbers to track growth (e.g., a score or percentage improvement).
They want something beyond “great job” ,  they’re asking for deeper analytics.
4. Limited Motivation Features
While some gamification exists, users mentioned they would appreciate more daily streaks, reminders, and motivational nudges.
5. Accuracy of AI Feedback (Mild Doubts)
A few users mentioned they’re not sure how accurate the AI is in evaluating their speech.
This introduces a small element of distrust or skepticism ,  especially for advanced users.
6. Too Much Focus on Anxiety/Calming
One user said the “calming and nervousness” section was over-emphasized and not helpful in actually improving skill ,  especially for someone who just wants better articulation or persuasion skills.
7. No Industry-Specific Modules
Users want tailored content for different careers or goals (like tech presentations, sales pitches, medical consultations, etc.).
